    <p>1. Laura Owens definitely utilizes modern technology a lot more in her works, such as that of digital rendering. These works have techniques similar to that of scanning and stretching something to reprint and etc. and thus in that way, a digital conception of taking a photo of a photo whereby transforming the meaning and intent of the original that Owens drew resource from. Technology definitely come into play and has a symbiotic relationship with Owens, some of the techniques made only possible with technology and so technology becomes a sort of a medium.</p>
    <p>2. Like mentioned above, Owens employ a wide range of forms and ideas rather than just classical painting, from printing, digital resizing, collaging and etc. Laura Owens truly paint paintings that of the post-modern age. Something that’s especially special about her work is that it draws resource from an original different idea and then transforms it, collagey in nature, it is not limited or restricted to any particular way of doing art.</p>
    <p>3. Her works both in terms of mediums and contents features this democracitization of ideas, free to use anything as part of the work, and also not being told or restricted by a sense of rules of what makes something art. It’s a bit non-sensical and free form, and also reminds me of meme culture sometimes.</p>
