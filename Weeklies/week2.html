  <p>1. Ayn Rand’s philosophy is extremely relevant today still in the kind of consumer, higher-capitalistic culture that we live in today, from economic policy/relations with foreign nation, to the extreme rich celebrities people follow, self-made moguls through internet— so much the dominant culture of today is based on this similar idea of self-hero and pursuit of own happiness, though often ignore to those more in need, and seems to go side by side with today’s society’s stream of post-modern meaningless-ness as well. Today’s ideology behind route of success leans much closer to the idea that meaningless self-sacrifice will bring about no change and effect at all.
Even America’s current policy to close in more and the general conservatism on the rise (although perhaps contrary to her idea of total freedom and laissez-faire capitalism) seems to be the government as a self acting for its own best self-interest, regardless of all others who live in the same world environment.</p>
  <p>2. The anonymity and connectivity of the internet is totally shaped by objectivism, in where it seemingly creates a space for people to be equals no matter their real world desire and identity. These people, now under their new face of mask, can even become “heroes” under the idea that the flow and pull of the internet are totally shaped and controlled by its users various choices. The hopes of the bitcoin Pangaea nation seems to be trying to push today’s not so utopian/idealistic internet into a model of free world that Ayn Rand wanted to build.</p>
  <p>3. Californian Ideology equates to the combination of radical individualism and utopian theory about computer systems. It seems to be the belief that computer as a neutral third party will provide and become the connector and regulator that connects all the individuals, where each individuals can focus on what’s best for their own self interest and leave it to the neutral computer to put out a system of organization and equality.</p>
