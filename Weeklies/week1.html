  <p>1. It seems that diagrams can be an attempt to arrive at the conclusion of the meaning of something. But rather than directly defining what meaning is, if that even can be defined, it carefully dissects meaning down into a few or many clues, and hopefully a comprehensive look at those individual qualities can help the questioners arrive at some sort of a conclusion. Diagrams are a thought process to attempt to understand a thought. Diagrams in this sense can help us dive in and take a closer look, but also forces us to think about “meaning” in more than just our usual assumed way. </p>
  <p>2. Diagrams for art and non-art should be related, because as Arakawa says that “to be an artist, you need to be a scientist first.” I think rather than literally all artist needs to become scientists, it’s more speaking to the fact that artists draw their inspirations, ideas and outlooks from life itself, therefore the full dissection of the surrounding environment and subject itself is deemed important, and thus the diagram serves that purpose for art, but it derives its basis from non-art. A diagram made with the intent of art or artist’ eyes behind it perhaps as this article suggests blend the objective and the subjective qualities and create a sort of romantic objective outlook.</p>
  <p>3. The relationships between diagrams, maps and networks is that diagrams itself can become a sort of a map or a network, thus I guess diagrams could be the dissected result of a system more complex or a more jumbled network, it is an attempt to map its way to some sort of multi-dimensional conclusion, a thought process designated to help us navigate, so in that sense kinda like a map made to cruise through a system of some sort. </p>
