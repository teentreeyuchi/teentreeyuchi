My upload was completed 3-months ago around the time of my death. <br>I know I died young because my avatar is a re-constucted image of previous existence, <br>but I do not remember the cause of my death. <br>It's against the rules of web-consciouness policy, in case some of us seek vengence I suppose.
          <br> This is supposed to be afterlife, the best of any kind we've got, better than eternal unknown darkness I suppose. <br> This is a simple place, but simplicity should suffice...<br>Lemme show you around! -->
