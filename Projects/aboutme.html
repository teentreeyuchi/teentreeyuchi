      Born in Beijing in 1997, then moving to Texas to study at the young age of  11 in 2009, Yuchi is a filmmaker and artist of international identity currently based in LA.  Yuchi graduated from the University of Southern California in Spring 2019, with a BFA degree in Film and TV Production. Since a young age, Yuchi has always been interested in drawing and photographing, but her interest in film-making only appeared during her late years of high school. Through her 4 years at USC, Yuchi has gained many new skills and experiences, proving herself and her vision among her peers by receiving various awards and even got to be 1 out of 4 USC Thesis film directors— showing her skills in leadership, communication and creativity. Yuchi's interests, influences and experiences go beyond filmmaking and also extends into painting, poetry, and more; she wishes to combine her knowledge in these multi-media platforms to create worlds of her own unique aesthetic and logical worldview. Through visuals and sound, Yuchi hopes to explore themes of time, environment, memories, missed connections, and etc with a touch of surrealism and create personable poetics and politics that reflect society as a whole, adding to art’s responsibility as cultural communicator influencer. Her work also seeks to tell the story and loneliness of her own experiences as a “third culture kid”- a child who is raised in a culture that is different from her parents'. Yuchi has very unique perspectives and visions that she wishes to install upon the world.
